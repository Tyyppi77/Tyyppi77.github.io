                        <p>
                        Hi, I'm Olli-Samuli. I study Computer Science at Aalto University School of Science.
                        </p>
                        <p>Looks like you've stumbled yourself onto my site! Here you can check out some of the projects I've worked one, the biggest one being my game GunHero. You can also find out how to get in touch with me here.</p>
                        <p>I enjoy programming a lot, but I'm also a fairly good with everything that has to do with game development: I can draw simple pixel art, compose music, design levels and edit trailers.</p>
                        <p>If I'm not programming or studying, I'm most likely playing the guitar. I've got a pretty cool pedal board setup which allows me to add all sorts of cool sounds and effects to my playing. I also like to make electronic music; I'm not very good at it though.</p>
                        <p>I'm fairly active on <a href="https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/users/35344/tyyppi-77?tab=profile">Game Dev Stack Exchange</a>, the Stack Overflow of game development. I answer mostly SDL and Pygame questions, as those are the two libraries that I have a lot of experience. I've also provided answers to more generic game-programming questions.</p>

                    <p class="m-2">GunHero is a 2D action-platformer-shooter that I developed using a custom C++ framework built ontop of SDL2. The development process of the game took about 2.5 years from first prototype to initial release on Steam. The game has been updated post release to for an example include support for custom player created levels shared using the Steam Workshop.</p>

                    <p class="m-2">The game consists of six differently themed areas with various obstacles and mechanics in each of them. Each area contains also a boss fight as the last level. There are a little over 125 levels in the game, built using the in-game level editor that was later released for public use.</p>

                    <p class="m-2">The codebase for the game is currently around 100 000 lines. SDL2 handles the window management, input handling, rendering and audio on a low level, but the rest is handled by the custom code written ontop of that.</p>

                    <p class="m-2">ImGuiSDL is a renderer for <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGui</a> that allows Dear ImGui to be rendered using a <code>SDL_Renderer.</code></p>

                    <p class="m-2">By default, Dear ImGui is designed to be easily rendered using any modern 3D rendering API, like OpenGL or DirectX, by sending vertex and index buffers to a simple shader. While the modern SDL2 rendering pipeline does use hardware acceleration behind the scenes, it does not expose a cross-platform interface to passing in generic vertex data. That's why I built ImGuiSDL.</p>

                    <p class="m-2">ImGuiSDL performs the rendering in two steps. First, it tries to find 6 adjacent vertices that form a rectangle that can be rendered in a quick fashion even if it is textured. If performing a rectangle rendering isn't possible, ImGuiSDL falls back to a fixed-point triangle rasterizer (that's not perfect but good enough for debug use, just like Dear ImGui is intended to be used). Because the triangle rasterization is slow, the result is cached into a render texture so that following frames can quickly just do a texture draw to the screen.</p>

                    <p class="m-2">ImGuiSDL is implemented in C++ in a easy-to-use manner: to use it, one needs to add two files to their build, and call one function to initialize the library and another to render.</p>
